# get voting data for all proposals in POH history

## Power Indices
```{r}

```

    }
  }
  
  # area below line of equality
  denom <- 2*(length(dist))^2*mean(dist)
  
  num/denom
}
```

```{r}
# compute Shapley-Shubik indices for a given distribution 
# params:
#   - dist: a distribution of voting power per voter
#   - thresh: the percentage of votes required to win, e.g. 0.5
ssi <- function(dist, thresh) {
  thresh_num <- ceiling(sum(dist)*thresh) # the number of votes required to win
  index_perm <- permn(1:length(dist)) # all possible voting orders

## Scratch

  nest()

# vote_records_1 <- test %>%
#   group_by(Voter.ID) %>%
#   nest() %>%
#   rename(Record = data)
# length(vote_records$Record[[3]])
# vote_records %>% filter(nrow(Record) == 1)

# vote_records %>% map( ~ .)
# map(vote_records$Record, ~ ifelse(nrow(.) > 1, print("yes"), ))
# vote_records %>% mutate(filtered = map(Record, ~ filter(., nrow(.) > 1)))
# vote_records %>% mutate(multi = ifelse(nrow(Record), TRUE, FALSE))

# map iterates through every column

# compare similarity between voters. Clustering analysis or just percentage of shared votes threshold?
